## Wildcard Arguments
- When you don't know how many argument to pass in a function.
- Non-keyword arguments: *args
- Keyword arguments e.g. greet(fname="Jacob" lname="Schutz"): **kwargs

## Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY code principles
- Group similar code and functions together in separate files
- Solves the problem of code file being too lengthy or complicated
- Can be accessed ...

## Packages
- Collection of modules
- Organise modules under one directory
- Initialise a package using __init__.py file 

## Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures like strings, tuples, etc. 
- Syntax: sequence[start:stop:step] (like range). Default of start is 0. Default of step is 1. If only one parameter is entered with a colon e.g. [:5] then that is the range or stopping point.

## Object Oriented Programming 

### Key Concepts
- Class
	- A blueprint for creating objects.
	- Defines a set of attributes or methods that the created objects (instances) will have
	- E.g. Blueprint provided while building a house, defining what an animal is

- Object 
	- An instance of a class. 
	- It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by class. 
	- E.g. a built house with many features (as functions)
